# What does this app do?

The background animations for the Flipper are controlled by a single manifest.txt file. However, it does not provide the user with the ability to truly switch between different animations (or presets of animations) at will. This app aims to solve that, allowing you to create and apply new manifest.txt files on the fly! Just select the animations you want, configure their butthurt, level and weight parameters, name the playlist and apply it.

# How do I use it?

The app is pretty intuitive, arrow buttons are used to navigate the menus, OK button is used to select options, back button is used to return. For additional help, please check the README file in the [official Animation Switcher repository](https://github.com/lsalik2/FlipperAnimationSwitcher)

# What's next?

- Manual manifest.txt import as a playlist
- Automatic backup of the previous manifest.txt before applying a new playlist
- Animation previewer screen
- Increase maximum animation count beyond 128
