## How can I install fmatrix? 

There's lot's of ways, but i'll just list three:

1: You can install fmatrix from the Flipper Lab above, or for those who are on the Github, here: https://lab.flipper.net/apps/fmatrix

2: Compile it in a .fap file format using ufbt (https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) and move it to your Flipper Zero using qFlipper (https://flipperzero.one/update)

3: On the GitHub repo (repo link below if on the Flipper Lab), download **the .fap file** from the Releases section and move it to your Flipper Zero using qFlipper (https://flipperzero.one/update), however it may be more up-to-date or farther behind.
