Flipper Zero App to generate interesting noises. This a bit juvenile sound app allows your Flipper to break winds with adjustable parameters 💨

   - **Wet/Dry**: Controls frequency variation - wet farts have more wobble, dry farts are more stable
   - **Length**: Duration from short (100ms) to long (900ms)
   - **Pitch**: Base frequency from low rumbles to higher squeaks 
   - **Bubbliness**: How often the sound modulates (smooth to very bubbly)
3. **Adjust**: Use Left/Right buttons to change the value (1-5)
4. **Play**: Press OK button to play the fart with current settings
5. **Exit**: Press Back button

## Background
Inspiration was an old C=64-programme written some decades ago to get acquainted to the SID sound chip &mdash; see [C=64-wiki in German](https://www.c64-wiki.de/wiki/SID) for details on the chip.
The legendary [C=64 Fart Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVqwgafmW7c) was much more advanced than my BASIC code back then, but gives you an idea what you can do with 3 voices and 4 waveforms on the "bread box".
