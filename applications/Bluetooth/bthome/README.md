This application turns the Flipper Zero into a [BTHome](https://bthome.io) beacon, and can be used to integrate the Flipper with home automation systems that support BTHome, such as Home Assistant.

See the [app's README](https://github.com/ghedo/flipper-playground/tree/master/bthome#readme) for more information.
