# Multi Fuzzer
## Flipper Zero app for checking ibutton readers .

**Not meant for any illegal activity/purposes.**

You can check your readers for vulnerabilities using the default UIDs and frequently used UIDs.

The application will also help to identify the "denial of service" vulnerability when providing an incorrect uid or when accessing the reader too often.

This is a completely remade app, visual style inspired by [iButton fuzzer](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/tree/58338ff51f6f9857f39ef07d5eb4495cdc02290d/applications/external/ibtn_fuzzer), the compatibility of user dictionaries is also preserved

## Supported protocols

- DS1990 (Dallas)
