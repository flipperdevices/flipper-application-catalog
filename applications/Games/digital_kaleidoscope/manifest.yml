short_description: Digital Kaleidoscope turns your Flipper Zero into a pocket-sized animated visualizer. Choose from four distinct kaleidoscope styles and adjust the pattern density on the fly.
description: |
  Digital Kaleidoscope is a lightweight app for Flipper Zero that transforms the device’s screen into a dynamic, ever-changing kaleidoscope. You get four unique visual styles, each with its own characteristics:
  
  - **Rotating Star**: A radiating starburst spins slowly around the center of the display, giving the impression of a celestial dance.
  - **Concentric Arcs**: Pixelated semi-circles expand and contract in rings from the middle of the screen, creating a fluid, ripple-like effect.
  - **Gradient Noise**: Random noise pixels appear brightest at the center and fade toward the edges. The pattern shifts subtly over time, producing a mesmerizing “shifting haze.”
  - **Mirrored Dots**: A static cloud of random dots is mirrored left-to-right. Unlike the other styles, this one does not animate automatically—you press an arrow key to regenerate the dot pattern whenever you like.

  You can fine-tune how “busy” each style looks by adjusting the density (0–100%) with the Up/Down buttons. The Left/Right arrows switch between the four visualizers, and pressing Back returns to the main menu.
