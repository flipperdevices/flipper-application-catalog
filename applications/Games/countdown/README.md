# Countdown

Numbers game for Flipper Zero inspired by the classic Countdown TV show.

- Pick 6 numbers from a grid (1–10, 25, 50, 75, 100).
- Then choose a 3-digit target between 100 and 999.
- The app tries to reach the target (or closest possible) using +, −, ×, ÷ without reusing numbers.
- Shows the final calculation steps and the time taken in milliseconds.
