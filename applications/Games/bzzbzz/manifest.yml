description: |
Haptic rhythm-matching game focusing on tactile feedback rather than visual cues.

- The app generates a 5-step vibration sequence.
- Gaps between vibrations are randomized between 200, 500, and 800ms.
- Users must replicate the timing using any navigation key or the OK button.
- Accuracy is calculated based on timing offsets; a >60% threshold is required to progress.
- Patterns auto-repeat after 5 seconds of inactivity.
