short_description: Haptic rhythm-matching game
description: |
  Haptic rhythm-matching game focusing on tactile feedback rather than visual cues.

  - The app generates a 5-step vibration sequence.
  - Gaps between vibrations are randomized between 200, 500, and 800ms.
  - Users must replicate the timing using any navigation key or the OK button.
  - Accuracy is calculated based on timing offsets; a >60% threshold is required to progress.
  - Patterns auto-repeat after 5 seconds of inactivity.
