# `mitzi_puck`
A simple Flipper Zero arcade chase game. The player controls a pie-shaped character ("Puck girl") through a maze, collecting dots while avoiding ghosts. Power pills temporarily make ghosts vulnerable.
Like in the classic game, each ghost has distinct personality: one targets directly, another one patrols. 

## Usage
- **Arrow Keys**: Move Puck-girl through the maze
- **OK Button**: Restart game (when game over or won)
- **Back Button**: Pauses game or (when held) exits

On the right, the user can track the lives of puck-girl &mdash; initially there are 3 filled hearts which become empty for each death of puck-girl. Underneath, there is a score-tracker.
