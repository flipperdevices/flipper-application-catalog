description: |
  Quadrastic is a simple addicting game inspired by the Arduboy game of the same name. This, in turn, was based on a popular PSP homebrew game called Squarez. Squarez itself drew inspiration from Ball, a game created by Nicolay Edin and Axel Hammarback, which was originally inspired by Eskiv, a game developed by Jean-Fran√ßois Geyelin.
