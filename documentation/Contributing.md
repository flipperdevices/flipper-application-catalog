    * We reserve the right to reject and remove applications that do not comply with these policies.

# Adding and Updating Applications

To submit an application, fork this repository, add your application manifest and create a pull request, filling in the pull request template. You may also include a `README.md` file with additional information about the application in the same directory as the manifest.

Recommended naming scheme for your branch is `<username>/<appid>_<appversion>`, where `username` is your GitHub username, `appid` is your application ID and `appversion` is your application's version. For example, `johndoe/myapp_1.0`.

Updating an application is done in the same way. Note that each submission must have a unique version. If you want to update an application, increment the version number in application's build system manifest (`application.fam`) in source code repo. See [manifest format description](./Manifest.md#application-version) for details.

# Technical Requirements

Applications must be buildable with [ufbt](https://pypi.org/project/ufbt/) and compatible with latest Release or Release Candidate firmware version at the moment of submission.

Application submission consists of two parts:
 - Application manifest: `applications/<category>/<application-id>/manifest.yml`, with all mandatory fields filled in. See [manifest format](./Manifest.md) for details.
 - An optional `README.md` file with additional information about the application in the same directory as the manifest.

## Validating Manifest

You can check your manifest file for validity before submitting it to this repository. To do so, set up a virtual Python environment with required dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
```

If you haven't yet installed the SDK for `ufbt` for your current user, you can install one within the virtual environment.

```bash
export UFBT_HOME=`realpath venv/ufbt`
ufbt update
```

Then run the validation script, passing it the path to your manifest file:

```bash
python3 tools/bundle.py --nolint applications/CATEGORY/APPID/manifest.yml bundle.zip
```

If there are any errors, the script will print them and exit with non-zero exit code. **Be sure to fix all errors before submitting your application.**
